# Dynatrace Extensions Skill

## Overview

Dynatrace extensions allow you to extend the functionality of Dynatrace by integrating with external systems and custom data sources. 

**When to use this skill:**

- Checking the status of installed extensions and their monitoring configurations
- Troubleshooting extension configuration issues using DQL queries and event logs

## Extensions lifecycle
Extensions are first installed, which brings assets (dashboards, alert templates, OpenPipeline rules etc). Once installed, each extension can have multiple activation - Monitoring Configurations. Configurations can run on ActiveGate or OneAgent, and can be enabled/disabled independently. Each configuration has its own status, which can be queried using this skill.

## Extensions Monitoring Configurations and Statuses

### Extensions Statuses

To check the status of an extension, you can run following DQL query:

```dql
timeseries count(dt.sfm.extension.config.status), by: {dt.extension.name, dt.extension.config.id, dt.extension.status}
```

- `dt.extension.name` — extension name
- `dt.extension.config.id` — monitoring configuration ID
- `dt.extension.status` — current status value

### 2. Retrieve Extension Event Logs

If a status is not `OK`, get detailed logs:

```dql
fetch dt.system.events
| filter dt.extension.name == "<extension_name>" AND dt.extension.config.id == "<config_id>"
```

Look for error codes in the `content` field. Error codes have the format `DEC:[A-Z0-9_]+`.

## Extension Status Reference

| Status | Meaning | Remediation |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `OK` | Running without issues | None |
| `STARTUP` / `STARTUP_PENDING` / `STARTUP_SCHEDULED` | Extension is starting | Wait for startup to complete |
| `RESTART` / `TIMED_OUT_RESTART` | Extension restarting | Monitor; if recurring, check logs |
| `IDLE` | Working but no status produced | Usually transient |
| `WARNING` | Warning state | Check extension logs |
| `GENERIC_ERROR` | Error state | Check extension logs |
| `STARTUP_ERROR` | Error during startup | Check extension logs and configuration |
| `HIGH_CPU` / `HIGH_CPU_RESTART` | Excessive CPU usage | Switch Performance Profile in ActiveGate settings |
| `HIGH_MEMORY` / `HIGH_MEMORY_RESTART` | Excessive memory usage | Switch Performance Profile in ActiveGate settings |
| `EEC_HARD_LIMIT_REJECTION` / `EEC_HARD_LIMIT_RESTART` | Resource hard limit hit | Switch Performance Profile in ActiveGate settings |
| `EEC_RESTSERVER_ERROR` | REST API port conflict | Check for port conflicts on the host |
| `EXTENSIONS_CACHE_ERROR` | Cannot download extension | Check disk space on ActiveGate/OneAgent |
| `EXTENSION_VERIFICATION_ERROR` | Malformed extension.yaml | Validate extension.yaml syntax |
| `CUSTOM_CODE_EXTENSION_NOT_ALLOWED` | Custom code blocked | Update ActiveGate or OneAgent |
| `INCOMPATIBLE_API_ERROR` | API version mismatch | Update ActiveGate/OneAgent or check extension docs |
| `MAX_TASKS_LIMIT_REJECTION` | Too many tasks | Add ActiveGates to the group or split groups |
| `MISSING_BINARY` / `MISSING_DATASOURCE` | Malformed installation | Reinstall ActiveGate or OneAgent |
| `GROUP_NAME_CHANGE` | Temporary rebalancing | Wait for rebalancing to complete |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Extension shows non-OK status**
   - Run the status query above to identify the specific status code
   - Check the status reference table for remediation
   - If unclear, fetch event logs for the extension

2. **Error codes in event logs**
   - Error codes follow the pattern `DEC:[A-Z0-9_]+`
   - Look up the code in [references/extensions-error-codes.md](references/extensions-error-codes.md)
   - If no error code is present, read the event `content` for details

3. **Extension keeps restarting**
   - Check for `HIGH_CPU_RESTART`, `HIGH_MEMORY_RESTART`, or `TIMED_OUT_RESTART`
   - Switch to a higher Performance Profile in ActiveGate settings
   - Review extension configuration for excessive scope

4. **Extension not producing data**
   - Verify status is `OK` (not `IDLE` or error state)
   - Check that the monitoring configuration is enabled
   - Verify network connectivity to the monitored system

## When to Load References

### Load extensions-error-codes.md when:
- You encounter a `DEC:*` error code in extension event logs
- You need the full error code catalog with remediation steps
