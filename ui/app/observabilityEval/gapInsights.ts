    title: "Backend traced but end-user experience is blind",
    description: "Application Observability is strong — services are instrumented and traces are flowing. But Digital Experience (RUM/Synthetic) coverage is low, so you have no visibility into what real users are experiencing.",
    recommendation: "Deploy RUM to your top web applications and add synthetic monitors for critical user journeys. Correlate user sessions to backend traces for full-stack visibility.",
    detail: "Impact: outages may be user-reported before monitoring catches them. MTTR is higher when there is no user-impact context.",

    title: "User experience tracked but backend is opaque",
    description: "Digital Experience monitoring is active — you can see user sessions and satisfaction scores. But Application Observability is weak, so when experience degrades you cannot trace it to a root cause service or span.",
    recommendation: "Enable distributed tracing on services backing your monitored web applications. Connect RUM session data to backend traces via OneAgent or OpenTelemetry.",
    detail: "Impact: experience issues are visible but not actionable — teams spend hours finding the backend cause manually.",

    description: "OneAgent deployment is healthy — hosts and services are instrumented. But Platform Governance (management zones, ownership teams, segments) is weak, so there is no structure for routing alerts, scoping access, or assigning responsibility.",
    recommendation: "Create management zones aligned to teams or services, assign ownership in the ownership catalog, and define segments for access scoping. This unlocks alerting profiles, SLO ownership, and team-based dashboards.",
    detail: "Impact: broad visibility but no accountability. Alert fatigue is common when all alerts go to everyone.",

    title: "Problems detected but remediation is manual",
    description: "Davis AI is well configured — anomaly detectors and alerting are active. But Automation coverage is low, meaning every problem requires manual intervention to resolve.",
    recommendation: "Build AutomationEngine workflows triggered by Davis problem events. Start with common patterns: restart unhealthy pods, scale services under load, open tickets automatically on critical problems.",
    detail: "Impact: MTTR is driven by human response time rather than automation speed. On-call burden is higher than necessary.",

    description: "Application Observability is strong — service traces, error rates, and response times are flowing. But Business Observability is weak, so technical metrics are not being connected to business outcomes.",
    recommendation: "Instrument key business transactions as BizEvents (orders, payments, conversions). Build business KPI dashboards. Use BizEvent processing pipelines to enrich with revenue and customer tier data.",

    description: "Extensions and cloud integrations are in use — AWS, Azure, or ActiveGate extensions are pulling in cloud metrics. But Platform Governance is weak, so cloud entities are not organized into management zones or ownership structures.",
    recommendation: "Create management zones that include cloud entities alongside on-premises hosts. Apply ownership tags to cloud workloads. Segment cloud environments (prod/dev/staging) using platform segments.",

    id: "gap-oneagent-apm",
    title: "Hosts covered but service-level tracing is weak",
    description: "OneAgent deployment is strong — hosts and processes are monitored. But Application Observability probes show low active tracing, suggesting services are not being traced at the code level.",
    recommendation: "Verify OneAgent is in full-stack mode (not infrastructure-only) for services that need APM. Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation for polyglot or serverless services. Check for custom service detection rules blocking trace capture.",
    detail: "Impact: process and host metrics are available but no distributed traces, no error detail, no dependency mapping at the service level.",

    title: "Infrastructure monitored but AI alerting is not configured",
    description: "Infrastructure Coverage is solid — hosts, services, and Kubernetes clusters are being monitored. But Davis AI coverage is low, meaning infrastructure anomalies are not being surfaced as actionable problems.",
    recommendation: "Enable Davis anomaly detectors for CPU, memory, disk, and network on critical hosts. Configure alerting profiles to route infrastructure problems to the right teams. Set up SLOs backed by infrastructure metrics.",
    detail: "Impact: monitoring is passive — data is collected but not acted on until humans notice issues in dashboards.",

    title: "Distributed traces active but logs are not correlated",
    description: "Application Observability is strong — distributed tracing is flowing. But Log Management is weak, meaning traces cannot be correlated with application logs, losing a critical troubleshooting dimension.",
    recommendation: "Enable log ingest via OneAgent or OpenTelemetry. Add trace context injection to application log output (trace ID, span ID). Configure OpenPipeline to enrich logs with service and version metadata.",
    detail: "Impact: engineers switch between trace and log tools manually during incidents, losing context and adding MTTR.",

    id: "gap-automation-davis",
    title: "Workflows running but not triggered by Davis problems",
    description: "Automation is active — workflows exist and are executing. But Davis AI coverage is low, so automation is likely triggered on schedules or manually rather than reactively to detected problems.",
    recommendation: "Connect Davis problem events as workflow triggers. Build self-healing workflows that react to specific problem types (deployment issues, resource exhaustion, availability drops).",
    detail: "Impact: automation potential is underutilized. Reactive workflows that respond to AI-detected problems deliver faster MTTR than scheduled ones.",

    description: "Davis AI is well configured — problems are being detected and alerted. But Digital Experience coverage is low, so Davis problems cannot be correlated with user impact, session data, or satisfaction scores.",
    recommendation: "Deploy RUM to surface user impact during Davis problems. Configure Davis to include user experience metrics in problem context. Use synthetic monitors to validate recovery from the user's perspective.",
    detail: "Impact: problems are caught but severity is assessed by engineers, not user impact data — leading to mistriaged priorities.",

    title: "Log pipeline active but no trace context enrichment",
    description: "Log Management is strong — Grail is ingesting and processing logs. But Application Observability is weak, meaning logs lack trace ID enrichment and cannot be linked to distributed traces.",
    recommendation: "Instrument application services to inject OpenTelemetry trace context into log output. Configure OpenPipeline processors to extract and index trace IDs. Enable log-to-trace correlation in the Dynatrace UI.",
    detail: "Impact: logs and traces exist in silos. Correlating them during incidents requires manual effort.",

    title: "Management zones defined but agent coverage has gaps",
    description: "Platform Governance is strong — management zones, ownership, and segments are configured. But OneAgent deployment is weak, meaning some entities in your governance structure are not actually being monitored.",
    recommendation: "Audit hosts and services within each management zone for agent coverage. Deploy or update OneAgent on hosts that are scoped into governance structures but showing as unmonitored. Use monitoring candidates to identify gaps.",
    detail: "Impact: governance promises coverage that does not exist — alerting profiles and SLOs within zones may fire on incomplete data.",

    recommendation: "Deploy ActiveGate-based cloud integrations for AWS, Azure, or GCP. Enable Extensions 2.0 for cloud-native services not covered by OneAgent. Consider AWS Lambda layer or Azure Monitor integration for serverless gaps.",
    detail: "Impact: cloud workloads are invisible. Hybrid environments have blind spots wherever cloud-native services interact with on-prem.",

    title: "Application errors detected but no automated recovery",
    description: "Application Observability is strong — error rates and problem detection are working. But Automation coverage is low, meaning application-level failures require manual response.",
    recommendation: "Build recovery workflows triggered by high error rate problems: auto-rollback deployments, restart failing services, scale replicas under load, and notify on-call with context-rich alerts.",

    recommendation: "Configure OpenPipeline to extract and emit BizEvents from structured log entries. Enrich BizEvents with log-level detail (error messages, stack traces) via processing pipeline rules.",

    description: "OneAgent deployment is strong on managed infrastructure. But Extensions coverage is low, suggesting cloud-native or third-party technology stacks (Kafka, Elasticsearch, custom hardware) are not being monitored.",
    recommendation: "Audit technology stacks not covered by OneAgent auto-injection. Deploy Extensions 2.0 for databases, message brokers, and networking components. Use ActiveGate extensions for infrastructure outside OneAgent reach.",
